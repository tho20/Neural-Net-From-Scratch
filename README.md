# Neural-Net-From-Scratch

### Objective: Build a Neural Network that predicts the next word in a sentence given the previous 3 

- Applying weight sharing
- Multi-layer perceptrons

$\rightarrow$ Solve it twice: 

- from scratch using numpy (Implementing forward propagation and backpropagation manually)    
- using PyTorch
